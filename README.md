# InStacksCode

This is the code for v2.0 of the Android app named, "InStacks".

The app allows end-users to download Instagram profile pictures. Instagram generally crops out the pic and you can't actually tap on the pics to enlarge it to enlarge them. This app does just that.

Feel free to explore the code and ping me (or why not fork and fix :P) if you encounter any bugs!

Please, Note:
You can watch, star or fork to create better versions of the app but you are not allowed to publish a copy or forked version without explicit permission.
